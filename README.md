This project utilized a lot of code provided by Google for training. My contribution was mostly some hyperparamter tuning which placed close to the top 100. If I had more time, 

* I would have tried to create subgraphs from the larger graph and train based on the graphs.
* Moved on from the google code which made it difficult to pass multiple configuration sets at training.
